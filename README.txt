A series of scripts for keeping track of timed tasks and reporting on
them. 

TimeTracker.py takes command line input and writes to a file, prepending
the text with a timestamp.

Files that are tracked are kept in a directory, currently
~/life-log/timetracker.log

These files are not connected with revesion control, or with the files
that act on them.
